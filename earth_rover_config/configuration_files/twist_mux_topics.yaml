# for lidar e stop node, it will only look at points in the direction the robot is driving
# if the robot is going forward, only the front 180º will be used
# backwards, back 180º. Rotating left, left 180º. Rotating right, right 180º
# for combinations, this 180º field can be angled accordingly

# This prevents a situation where the robot detects a wall but the joystick can't take control
# because the point is still within the bounding box of the robot. The joystick will only be
# allowed control if the lidar e stop node detects its driving away from the wall
